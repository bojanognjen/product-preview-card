HTML/CSS & Responsive Design

## Acknowledgments

Working on this project, I used HTML and CSS. It was the first time I developed something using responsive design techniques. Kevin Powell and his video tutorials helped me a lot, and I used things like the :is() pseudo-class for the first time, as well as features that assist blind people in accessing content.
